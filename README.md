# credit-risk-classification

In this Challenge, we will use various techniques to train and evaluate a model based on loan risk. You’ll use a dataset of historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company to build a model that can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers.

## What we will learn from this project:

- How to split the data into training and testing sets

- How to create a Logistic Regression Model with the Original Data

- How to predict a Logistic Regression Model with Resampled Training Data

- How to write a credit risk analysis report

## Instructions:

* Split the Data into Training and Testing Sets:
  
  - Read the data into a Pandas DataFrame.

  - Create the labels set (y) from the “loan_status” column, and then create the features (X) DataFrame from the remaining columns.

* Create a Logistic Regression Model with the Original Data:
  
  - Fit a Logistic Regression model by using the Training Tata (X_train and y_train).

  - Save the predictions for the testing data labels by using the testing feature data (X_test) and the fitted model.

  - Evaluate the model’s performance.

* Predict a Logistic Regression Model with Resampled Training Data:

   - Resample the training data. 

   - Fit a Logistic Regression Model using the resampled data.
   
   - Save the predictions on the testing data labels by using the testing feature data and the fitted model.
   
   - Evaluate the model’s performance.

* Write a Credit Risk Analysis Report
